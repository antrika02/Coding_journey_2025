# Coding_journey_2025
This repository is a collection of my daily Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions, primarily in Java. The goal is to stay consistent, strengthen problem-solving skills, and prepare effectively for coding interviews.

Each solution is organized by topic and problem, covering areas like:

Arrays & Strings

Recursion & Backtracking

Dynamic Programming

Linked Lists & Trees

Graphs & Greedy Algorithms

Stack, Queue & Heap problems

ðŸ”¹ By committing every day, this repo serves as both a learning journal and a resource for revision. Over time, it will grow into a structured set of solutions useful for interview prep and competitive programming.
